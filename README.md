# Mon Terrarium, a website to make terrarium keeping easy
This is my website project, , created in grade 10 (available in french only). It's goal was to make keeping a terrarium easy, while improving my web programming skills at the same time. I enjoyed making this site, and I hope you will enjoy looking at it too !

I am trying to make the process of sharing my website easier by using Github Pages and learning new stuff through that process, so if you have any suggestion, I am always open to hear them.
